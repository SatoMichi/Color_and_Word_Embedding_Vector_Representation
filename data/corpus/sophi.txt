As when the Tartar from his Russian foe , By Astracan , over the snowy plains , Retires ; or Bactrin Sophi , from the horns Of Turkish crescent , leaves all waste beyond The realm of Aladule , in his retreat To Tauris or Casbeen : So these , the late Heaven - banished host , left desart utmost Hell Many a dark league , reduced in careful watch Round their metropolis ; and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer , from the search Of foreign worlds : He through the midst unmarked , In show plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order , passed ; and from the door Of that Plutonian hall , invisible Ascended his high throne ; which , under state Of richest texture spread , at the upper end Was placed in regal lustre .
