" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern .
in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined ."
13 : 29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard ; 13 : 30 Then the priest shall see the plague : and , behold , if it be in sight deeper than the skin ; and there be in it a yellow thin hair ; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a dry scall , even a leprosy upon the head or beard .
13 : 31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall , and , behold , it be not in sight deeper than the skin , and that there is no black hair in it ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days : 13 : 32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague : and , behold , if the scall spread not , and there be in it no yellow hair , and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin ; 13 : 33 He shall be shaven , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more : 13 : 34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall : and , behold , if the scall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
13 : 35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing ; 13 : 36 Then the priest shall look on him : and , behold , if the scall be spread in the skin , the priest shall not seek for yellow hair ; he is unclean .
68 : 13 Though ye have lien among the pots , yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver , and her feathers with yellow gold .
THE LITTLE YELLOW TULIP
Once there was a little yellow Tulip , and she lived down in a little dark house under the ground .
It was early springtime , and few other flowers were to be seen ; but she had the birds to sing to her and the sun to shine upon her pretty yellow head .
Suddenly he saw a big yellow light at the very edge of the sky .
Down along the rocky shore Some make their home -- They live on crispy pancakes Of yellow tide - foam ; Some in the reeds Of the black mountain - lake , With frogs for their watch - dogs , All night awake .
One day she gave him a big piece of cake ; nice , yellow , rich gold - cake .
They made a wonderful big pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow , trimmed with yellow paper , and Cinderella rolled away in it , when the fairy godmother waved her wand .
The wife cut out two tiny , tiny coats of green , two weeny , weeny waistcoats of yellow , two little pairs of trousers , of white , two bits of caps , bright red ( for every one knows the elves love bright colours ), and her husband made two little pairs of shoes with long , pointed toes .
" Flowers ," said Margery , with shining eyes ,--" blue , and white , and yellow , and pink ,-- every kind of flower !"
At the back were the sweet peas , which would grow tall , like a screen ; on the two sides , for a kind of hedge , were yellow sunflowers ; and along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums .
And then , in little square patches all round the garden , were planted London pride , blue bachelor ' s buttons , yellow marigolds , tall larkspur , many - coloured asters , hollyhocks and stocks .
It is like asking if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep .
A small but very neat black - and - yellow motor - car was standing stolidly , slightly to the left of the road .
The fourth , however , had already advanced on the chauffeur of the black - and - yellow car , and was threatening him with a stick .
The sea that lay before them was like a pavement of emerald , bright and almost brittle ; the sky against which its strict horizon hung was almost absolutely white , except that close to the sky line , like scarlet braids on the hem of a garment , lay strings of flaky cloud of so gleaming and gorgeous a red that they seemed cut out of some strange blood - red celestial metal , of which the mere gold of this earth is but a drab yellow imitation .
She had very broad , low , and level brows , which seemed even lower because her warm yellow hair clustered down to her eyebrows ; and she had a face just plump enough not to look as powerful as it was .
He was a large , lean man , with the stoop of an aged eagle , and even the eagle ' s nose to complete it ; he had old - fashioned military whiskers and moustache dyed with a garish and highly incredible yellow .
Ye he was decidedly a handsome figure with his curled yellow hair and lean fastidious face ; and he wore a peculiar frock - coat of bright turquoise blue , with an unknown order pinned to it , and he carried a huge and heavy cane .
The incomprehensible Count Gregory , with his yellow hair like flame and his face like the white ashes of the flame , was advancing bareheaded towards her , flinging out his arms and his long fingers with a frantic gesture .
Now she was startled with a new sanity ; for the tall man in the yellow whiskers and yellow moustache first returned the blow of Bert , as if it were a sort of duty , and then stepped back with a slight bow and an easy smile .
The prompt reply of Count Gregory was to pull off his large yellow whiskers and scatter them on the breeze with an air of considerable relief .
His face , which was reflective and somewhat over - refined , was the face of a quite elderly man , though his stringy hair and moustache were still quite yellow .
That carefully cut and pointed yellow beard was , indeed , the most emphatic thing about him .
It was of that innocent lonely yellow which has never heard of orange , though it might turn quite unconsciously into green .
A white early moon was hardly traceable upon that delicate yellow .
There was the Tolstoyan in Jaeger flannel , with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and eyes that went forward , with the curiosity of a crank .
The site of the old half - wit ' s cell was now the heart of a standing forest of fire -- the flames as thick and yellow as a cornfield .
This figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check , with a pink tie , a sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots .
Outside was strong sunlight with a wind ; and a yellow head of some broom or gorse in the garden rapped against the glass of the window .
His lank limbs were clad , I might also say clutched , in very tight grey sleeves and pantaloons ; he had a long , sallow , aquiline face which seemed somehow all the more saturnine because his lantern jaws were imprisoned in his collar and neck - cloth more in the style of the old stock ; and his hair ( which ought to have been dark brown ) was of an odd dim , russet colour which , in conjunction with his yellow face , looked rather purple than red .
That is , that while it was ruddy and sanguine , there was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly , but seemed rather to glow like gold apples of the Hesperides -- Father Brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive of all the romances about the countries of the Sun .
The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by three circular garden beds , one of red tulips , a second of yellow tulips , and the third of some white , waxen - looking blossoms that the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic .
Almost as he spoke , the butler , a lean man in black , with very black hair and a very long , yellow face , appeared in the doorway and told him that dinner was served .
But the alien colour culminated in the fact that , besides the butler , the Admiral ' s only servants were two negroes , somewhat quaintly clad in tight uniforms of yellow .
Towards the end of the dinner they took their yellow clothes and black faces out of the room , leaving only the black clothes and yellow face of the butler .
With the same mixed emotions they watched him uncoil some considerable lengths of the large garden hose , saying with an air of wistful discrimination : " The red tulips before the yellow , I think .
But in the blood - red glare , with their black faces and yellow figures , they looked like devils carrying instruments of torture .
But as I was saying ," he resumed , as the negro , still ostentatiously pulling on his yellow gloves , betook himself briskly towards the watering - place , a queer music - hall figure against that grey and frosty scene --" as I was saying , I couldn ' t describe the man very minutely , but he had a flourish and old - fashioned whiskers and moustachios , dark or dyed , as in the pictures of foreign financiers , round his neck was wrapped a long purple scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he walked .
The yellow lamps were beginning to be lit in the cold blue twilight , and they were evidently approaching the more central parts of the town .
He had a large palm - leaf hat on the back of his head ( suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face ), but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas ; which , though glowing enough to behold , must have been , on a fresh morning , pretty chilly to wear .
The figure was much longer , leaner , and more athletic ; the pyjamas , though equally tropical , were comparatively tasteful , being of white with a light lemon - yellow stripe .
He was indeed emphatic , but then he was talking to his cook -- the swarthy son of Malta , whose lean , yellow and rather careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow - white cap and costume .
He laid down a gory yellow " shocker " without even feeling its incongruity enough to comment on it humorously .
He was clad in his full white and yellow uniform , as to receive his guests within , except that the sash or scarf had been unbound and lay rather crumpled by his side .
The new poet , who introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very mild - looking mortal , with a fair , pointed beard and faint , yellow hair .
But when Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red subterranean light , Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown over the other , and had not turned a yellow hair .
Also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards , cut and pointed , on the lawns of Saffron Park .
Acting under the advice of his friend the policeman ( who was professionally inclined to neatness ), he trimmed his hair and beard , bought a good hat , clad himself in an exquisite summer suit of light blue - grey , with a pale yellow flower in the button - hole , and , in short , became that elegant and rather insupportable person whom Gregory had first encountered in the little garden of Saffron Park .
he asked himself , biting his yellow moustache .
He saw the yellow panes of a low , lighted public - house , flung himself into it and ordered beer .
Taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist coat pocket , he tossed it on to the table ; then he flung his head back until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling , and shouted with a barbaric laughter .
Syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair , and his eyes were burning feverishly .
With a sharp gesture he motioned them to silence , but he pointed with one gloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the Marquis de St . Eustache , his teeth shining in his thick , black beard , and his bold , brown face shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea .
And he stood up suddenly , his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze .
But , indeed , this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black business .
He remembered a hornbill , which was simply a huge yellow beak with a small bird tied on behind it .
His silk hat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough , his coat - tails were torn to the shoulder by arresting thorns , the clay of England was splashed up to his collar ; but he still carried his yellow beard forward with a silent and furious determination , and his eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of gas , which in the full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud .
He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class , to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair ; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was -- blood running down his face from where the bough had struck him , his hair standing out like yellow rags of rank grass , his clothes torn into long , wavering tatters .
Dawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid ; as if Nature made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose .
I know what he thought of Bab by his looks , and of Susan , too ; for Susan was in her garden , bending down a branch of the laburnum - tree , looking at its yellow flowers , which were just come out ; and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was from Shrewsbury , she answered him so modest !-- not bashful , like as if she had never seen nobody before -- but just right ; and then she pulled on her straw hat , which was fallen back with her looking up at the laburnum , and she went her ways home ; and the gentleman says to me , after she was gone , ' Pray , who is that neat , modest girl --?'
Ev ' n in the spring and playtime of the year , That calls th ' unwonted villager abroad , With all her little ones , a sportive train , To gather king - cups in the yellow mead , And prink their heads with daisies .
" It never will do , sir ," persisted the lad ; " look at it yourself ; the edges are all yellow !
Put this shining yellow counter ," continued she , pointing to the guinea , " in your pocket , and make what use of it you please .
Her little brothers begged the man to stay a few minutes , for they had gathered a handful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot , and they were decking the poor animal .
" Mr . Keity , yellow and black velvet ; helmet trimmed with silver .
And yet , till now , I always took you for " a dead - shot at a yellow - hammer .
* Young noblemen at Oxford wear yellow tufts at the tops of their caps .
Hence their flatterers are said to be dead - shots at yellow - hammers .
I shall see all your yellow flowers withered tomorrow ; but it is done , and it cannot be helped ; so , Arthur , let us say no more about it ."
" Oh , I only mixed red , blue , green and yellow , to show you , Marianne , that all colours mixed together make white .
They hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles ; and , forming themselves into a formidable phalanx , they proceeded towards Piedro ' s well known yellow lettered board , exclaiming , as they went along , " Common cause !
It was of a dark , purplish , yellow colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares .
To be sure , it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning ; but I never heard of a hot sun ' s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one .
But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard , and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard , and that done , then ask the first man we met where the place was : these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first , especially as , at the outset , Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse -- our first point of departure -- must be left on the larboard hand , whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard .
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown , standing in the porch of the inn , under a dull red lamp swinging there , that looked much like an injured eye , and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt .
and so saying , taking out his spectacles , he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief , and putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam , and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks , took a good long look at Queequeg .
Or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ?
Less swart in aspect , the companions of this figure were of that vivid , tiger - yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas ;-- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil , their lord , whose counting - room they suppose to be elsewhere .
" Never heed yonder yellow boys , Archy ."
" What think ye of those yellow boys , sir !
Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone ; like five trip - hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength , which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer .
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger - yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land .
Steering north - eastward from the Crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds .
As morning mowers , who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads ; even so these monsters swam , making a strange , grassy , cutting sound ; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea .
An intense copper calm , like a universal yellow lotus , was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea .
He was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair .
" Think , think of the fevers , yellow and bilious !
Now , during the past night and forenoon , the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea , which , by its occasional patches of yellow brit , gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales , a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near .
You might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour .
Long maintaining an enchanted silence , Ahab stood apart ; and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit , he turned to eye the bright sun ' s rays produced ahead ; and when she profoundly settled by the stern , he turned behind , and saw the sun ' s rearward place , and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake .
With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the tiger - yellow crew were tumbling over each other ' s heads to gain the uttermost stern .
But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried ; and whether it was that Ahab ' s crew were all such tiger - yellow barbarians , and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks -- a matter sometimes well known to affect them ,-- however it was , they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others .
His eyes he opened , and beheld a field , Part arable and tilth , whereon were sheaves New reaped ; the other part sheep - walks and folds ; I ' the midst an altar as the land - mark stood , Rustick , of grassy sord ; thither anon A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought First fruits , the green ear , and the yellow sheaf , Unculled , as came to hand ; a shepherd next , More meek , came with the firstlings of his flock , Choicest and best ; then , sacrificing , laid The inwards and their fat , with incense strowed , On the cleft wood , and all due rights performed : His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven Consumed with nimble glance , and grateful steam ; The other ' s not , for his was not sincere ; Whereat he inly raged , and , as they talked , Smote him into the midriff with a stone That beat out life ; he fell ; and , deadly pale , Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused .
I haue liu ' d long enough : my way of life Is falne into the Seare , the yellow Leafe , And that which should accompany Old - Age , As Honor , Loue , Obedience , Troopes of Friends , I must not looke to haue : but in their steed , Curses , not lowd but deepe , Mouth - honor , breath Which the poore heart would faine deny , and dare not .
I believe in those wing ' d purposes , And acknowledge red , yellow , white , playing within me , And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional , And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else , And the in the woods never studied the gamut , yet trills pretty well to me , And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me .

By the city ' s quadrangular houses -- in log huts , camping with lumber - men , Along the ruts of the turnpike , along the dry gulch and rivulet bed , Weeding my onion - patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips , crossing savannas , trailing in forests , Prospecting , gold - digging , girdling the trees of a new purchase , Scorch ' d ankle - deep by the hot sand , hauling my boat down the shallow river , Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead , where the buck turns furiously at the hunter , Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock , where the otter is feeding on fish , Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou , Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey , where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle - shaped tall ; Over the growing sugar , over the yellow - flower ' d cotton plant , over the rice in its low moist field , Over the sharp - peak ' d farm house , with its scallop ' d scum and slender shoots from the gutters , Over the western persimmon , over the long - leav ' d corn , over the delicate blue - flower flax , Over the white and brown buckwheat , a hummer and buzzer there with the rest , Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze ; Scaling mountains , pulling myself cautiously up , holding on by low scragged limbs , Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush , Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat - lot , Where the bat flies in the Seventh - month eve , where the great goldbug drops through the dark , Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow , Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides , Where the cheese - cloth hangs in the kitchen , where andirons straddle the hearth - slab , where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters ; Where trip - hammers crash , where the press is whirling its cylinders , Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs , Where the pear - shaped balloon is floating aloft , ( floating in it myself and looking composedly down ,) Where the life - car is drawn on the slip - noose , where the heat hatches pale - green eggs in the dented sand , Where the she - whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it , Where the steam - ship trails hind - ways its long pennant of smoke , Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water , Where the half - burn ' d brig is riding on unknown currents , Where shells grow to her slimy deck , where the dead are corrupting below ; Where the dense - starr ' d flag is borne at the head of the regiments , Approaching Manhattan up by the long - stretching island , Under Niagara , the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance , Upon a door - step , upon the horse - block of hard wood outside , Upon the race - course , or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base - ball , At he - festivals , with blackguard gibes , ironical license , bull - dances , drinking , laughter , At the cider - mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash , sucking the juice through a straw , At apple - peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find , At musters , beach - parties , friendly bees , huskings , house - raisings ;

Looking in at the shop - windows of Broadway the whole forenoon , flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass , Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn ' d up to the clouds , or down a lane or along the beach , My right and left arms round the sides of two friends , and I in the middle ; Coming home with the silent and dark - cheek ' d bush - boy , ( behind me he rides at the drape of the day ,) Far from the settlements studying the print of animals ' feet , or the moccasin print , By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient , Nigh the coffin ' d corpse when all is still , examining with a candle ; Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure , Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any , Hot toward one I hate , ready in my madness to knife him , Solitary at midnight in my back yard , my thoughts gone from me a long while , Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side , Speeding through space , speeding through heaven and the stars , Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring , and the diameter of eighty thousand miles , Speeding with tail ' d meteors , throwing fire - balls like the rest , Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly , Storming , enjoying , planning , loving , cautioning , Backing and filling , appearing and disappearing , I tread day and night such roads .
This man was a wonderful vigor , calmness , beauty of person , The shape of his head , the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard , the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes , the richness and breadth of his manners , These I used to go and visit him to see , he was wise also , He was six feet tall , he was over eighty years old , his sons were massive , clean , bearded , tan - faced , handsome , They and his daughters loved him , all who saw him loved him , They did not love him by allowance , they loved him with personal love , He drank water only , the blood show ' d like scarlet through the clear - brown skin of his face , He was a frequent gunner and fisher , he sail ' d his boat himself , he had a fine one presented to him by a ship - joiner , he had fowling - pieces presented to him by men that loved him , When he went with his five sons and many grand - sons to hunt or fish , you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang , You would wish long and long to be with him , you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other .
Spontaneous me , Nature , The loving day , the mounting sun , the friend I am happy with , The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder , The hillside whiten ' d with blossoms of the mountain ash , The same late in autumn , the hues of red , yellow , drab , purple , and light and dark green , The rich coverlet of the grass , animals and birds , the private untrimm ' d bank , the primitive apples , the pebble - stones , Beautiful dripping fragments , the negligent list of one after another as I happen to call them to me or think of them , The real poems , ( what we call poems being merely pictures ,) The poems of the privacy of the night , and of men like me , This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry , and that all men carry , ( Know once for all , avow ' d on purpose , wherever are men like me , are our lusty lurking masculine poems ,) Love - thoughts , love - juice , love - odor , love - yielding , love - climbers , and the climbing sap , Arms and hands of love , lips of love , phallic thumb of love , breasts of love , bellies press ' d and glued together with love , Earth of chaste love , life that is only life after love , The body of my love , the body of the woman I love , the body of the man , the body of the earth , Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south - west , The hairy wild - bee that murmurs and hankers up and down , that gripes the full - grown lady - flower , curves upon her with amorous firm legs , takes his will of her , and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied ; The wet of woods through the early hours , Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep , one with an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other , The smell of apples , aromas from crush ' d sage - plant , mint , birch - bark , The boy ' s longings , the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming , The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content to the ground , The no - form ' d stings that sights , people , objects , sting me with , The hubb ' d sting of myself , stinging me as much as it ever can any one , The sensitive , orbic , underlapp ' d brothers , that only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are , The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body , the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves , The limpid liquid within the young man , The vex ' d corrosion so pensive and so painful , The torment , the irritable tide that will not be at rest , The like of the same I feel , the like of the same in others , The young man that flushes and flushes , and the young woman that flushes and flushes , The young man that wakes deep at night , the hot hand seeking to repress what would master him , The mystic amorous night , the strange half - welcome pangs , visions , sweats , The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers , the young man all color ' d , red , ashamed , angry ; The souse upon me of my lover the sea , as I lie willing and naked , The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun , the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them , The walnut - trunk , the walnut - husks , and the ripening or ripen ' d long - round walnuts , The continence of vegetables , birds , animals , The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent , while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent , The great chastity of paternity , to match the great chastity of maternity , The oath of procreation I have sworn , my Adamic and fresh daughters , The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw , till I saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through , The wholesome relief , repose , content , And this bunch pluck ' d at random from myself , It has done its work -- I toss it carelessly to fall where it may .
I see the long river - stripes of the earth , I see the Amazon and the Paraguay , I see the four great rivers of China , the Amour , the Yellow River , the Yiang - tse , and the Pearl , I see where the Seine flows , and where the Danube , the Loire , the Rhone , and the Guadalquiver flow , I see the windings of the Volga , the Dnieper , the Oder , I see the Tuscan going down the Arno , and the Venetian along the Po , I see the Greek seaman sailing out of Egina bay .
I too many and many a time cross ' d the river of old , Watched the Twelfth - month sea - gulls , saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings , oscillating their bodies , Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow , Saw the slow - wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south , Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water , Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams , Look ' d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water , Look ' d on the haze on the hills southward and south - westward , Look ' d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet , Look ' d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving , Saw their approach , saw aboard those that were near me , Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops , saw the ships at anchor , The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars , The round masts , the swinging motion of the hulls , the slender serpentine pennants , The large and small steamers in motion , the pilots in their pilothouses , The white wake left by the passage , the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels , The flags of all nations , the falling of them at sunset , The scallop - edged waves in the twilight , the ladled cups , the frolic - some crests and glistening , The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer , the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks , On the river the shadowy group , the big steam - tug closely flank ' d on each side by the barges , the hay - boat , the belated lighter , On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night , Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses , and down into the clefts of streets .
cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses !
The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Mississippi , he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around ; California life , the miner , bearded , dress ' d in his rude costume , the stanch California friendship , the sweet air , the graves one in passing meets solitary just aside the horse - path ; Down in Texas the cotton - field , the negro - cabins , drivers driving mules or oxen before rude carts , cotton bales piled on banks and wharves ; Encircling all , vast - darting up and wide , the American Soul , with equal hemispheres , one Love , one Dilation or Pride ; In arriere the peace - talk with the Iroquois the aborigines , the calumet , the pipe of good - will , arbitration , and indorsement , The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then toward the earth , The drama of the scalp - dance enacted with painted faces and guttural exclamations , The setting out of the war - party , the long and stealthy march , The single file , the swinging hatchets , the surprise and slaughter of enemies ; All the acts , scenes , ways , persons , attitudes of these States , reminiscences , institutions , All these States compact , every square mile of these States without excepting a particle ; Me pleas ' d , rambling in lanes and country fields , Paumanok ' s fields , Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies shuffling between each other , ascending high in the air , The darting swallow , the destroyer of insects , the fall traveler southward but returning northward early in the spring , The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows and shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the roadside , The city wharf , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Charleston , New Orleans , San Francisco , The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan ; Evening -- me in my room -- the setting sun , The setting summer sun shining in my open window , showing the swarm of flies , suspended , balancing in the air in the centre of the room , darting athwart , up and down , casting swift shadows in specks on the opposite wall where the shine is ; The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners , Males , females , immigrants , combinations , the copiousness , the individuality of the States , each for itself -- the moneymakers , Factories , machinery , the mechanical forces , the windlass , lever , pulley , all certainties , The certainty of space , increase , freedom , futurity , In space the sporades , the scatter ' d islands , the stars -- on the firm earth , the lands , my lands , O lands !
2 The flashing and golden pageant of California , The sudden and gorgeous drama , the sunny and ample lands , The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south , Lands bathed in sweeter , rarer , healthier air , valleys and mountain cliffs , The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow , the silent , cyclic chemistry , The slow and steady ages plodding , the unoccupied surface ripening , the rich ores forming beneath ; At last the New arriving , assuming , taking possession , A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere , Ships coming in from the whole round world , and going out to the whole world , To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises of the Pacific , Populous cities , the latest inventions , the steamers on the rivers , the railroads , with many a thrifty farm , with machinery , And wool and wheat and the grape , and diggings of yellow gold .
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking , Out of the mocking - bird ' s throat , the musical shuttle , Out of the Ninth - month midnight , Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond , where the child leaving his bed wander ' d alone , bareheaded , barefoot , Down from the shower ' d halo , Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive , Out from the patches of briers and blackberries , From the memories of the bird that chanted to me , From your memories sad brother , from the fitful risings and fallings I heard , From under that yellow half - moon late - risen and swollen as if with tears , From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist , From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease , From the myriad thence - arous ' d words , From the word stronger and more delicious than any , From such as now they start the scene revisiting , As a flock , twittering , rising , or overhead passing , Borne hither , ere all eludes me , hurriedly , A man , yet by these tears a little boy again , Throwing myself on the sand , confronting the waves , I , chanter of pains and joys , uniter of here and hereafter , Taking all hints to use them , but swiftly leaping beyond them , A reminiscence sing .
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow ?
Carols under that lagging , yellow , waning moon !
The aria sinking , All else continuing , the stars shining , The winds blowing , the notes of the bird continuous echoing , With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning , On the sands of Paumanok ' s shore gray and rustling , The yellow half - moon enlarged , sagging down , drooping , the face of the sea almost touching , The boy ecstatic , with his bare feet the waves , with his hair the atmosphere dallying , The love in the heart long pent , now loose , now at last tumultuously bursting , The aria ' s meaning , the ears , the soul , swiftly depositing , The strange tears down the cheeks coursing , The colloquy there , the trio , each uttering , The undertone , the savage old mother incessantly crying , To the boy ' s soul ' s questions sullenly timing , some drown ' d secret hissing , To the outsetting bard .
O you singer solitary , singing by yourself , projecting me , O solitary me listening , never more shall I cease perpetuating you , Never more shall I escape , never more the reverberations , Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me , Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there in the night , By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon , The messenger there arous ' d , the fire , the sweet hell within , The unknown want , the destiny of me .
Then to the third -- a face nor child nor old , very calm , as of beautiful yellow - white ivory ; Young man I think I know you -- I think this face is the face of the Christ himself , Dead and divine and brother of all , and here again he lies .
I dress a wound in the side , deep , deep , But a day or two more , for see the frame all wasted and sinking , And the yellow - blue countenance see .
Why wag your head with turban bound , yellow , red and green ?
5 Over the breast of the spring , the land , amid cities , Amid lanes and through old woods , where lately the violets peep ' d from the ground , spotting the gray debris , Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes , passing the endless grass , Passing the yellow - spear ' d wheat , every grain from its shroud in the dark - brown fields uprisen , Passing the apple - tree blows of white and pink in the orchards , Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave , Night and day journeys a coffin .
Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes , With the Fourth - month eve at sundown , and the gray smoke lucid and bright , With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous , indolent , sinking sun , burning , expanding the air , With the fresh sweet herbage under foot , and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific , In the distance the flowing glaze , the breast of the river , with a wind - dapple here and there , With ranging hills on the banks , with many a line against the sky , and shadows , And the city at hand with dwellings so dense , and stacks of chimneys , And all the scenes of life and the workshops , and the workmen homeward returning .
Busy the far , the sunlit panorama , Prairie , orchard , and yellow grain of the North , Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane , Open unseeded fallows , rich fields of clover and timothy , Kine and horses feeding , and droves of sheep and swine , And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook , And healthy uplands with herby - perfumed breezes , And the good green grass , that delicate miracle the ever - recurring grass .
The field - sprouts of Fourth - month and Fifth - month became part of him , Winter - grain sprouts and those of the light - yellow corn , and the esculent roots of the garden , And the apple - trees cover ' d with blossoms and the fruit afterward , and wood - berries , and the commonest weeds by the road , And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern whence he had lately risen , And the schoolmistress that pass ' d on her way to the school , And the friendly boys that pass ' d , and the quarrelsome boys , And the tidy and fresh - cheek ' d girls , and the barefoot negro boy and girl , And all the changes of city and country wherever he went .
The grass of spring covers the prairies , The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden , The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward , The apple - buds cluster together on the apple - branches , The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves , The tinge awakes over the willow - tree and the mulberry - tree , The he - birds carol mornings and evenings while the she - birds sit on their nests , The young of poultry break through the hatch ' d eggs , The new - born of animals appear , the calf is dropt from the cow , the colt from the mare , Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato ' s dark green leaves , Out of its hill rises the yellow maize - stalk , the lilacs bloom in the dooryards , The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead .
Warble me now for joy of lilac - time , ( returning in reminiscence ,) Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature ' s sake , souvenirs of earliest summer , Gather the welcome signs , ( as children with pebbles or stringing shells ,) Put in April and May , the hylas croaking in the ponds , the elastic air , Bees , butterflies , the sparrow with its simple notes , Blue - bird and darting swallow , nor forget the high - hole flashing his golden wings , The tranquil sunny haze , the clinging smoke , the vapor , Shimmer of waters with fish in them , the cerulean above , All that is jocund and sparkling , the brooks running , The maple woods , the crisp February days and the sugar - making , The robin where he hops , bright - eyed , brown - breasted , With musical clear call at sunrise , and again at sunset , Or flitting among the trees of the apple - orchard , building the nest of his mate , The melted snow of March , the willow sending forth its yellow - green sprouts , For spring - time is here !
Through the soft evening air enwinding all , Rocks , woods , fort , cannon , pacing sentries , endless wilds , In dulcet streams , in flutes ' and cornets ' notes , Electric , pensive , turbulent , artificial , ( Yet strangely fitting even here , meanings unknown before , Subtler than ever , more harmony , as if born here , related here , Not to the city ' s fresco ' d rooms , not to the audience of the opera house , Sounds , echoes , wandering strains , as really here at home , Sonnambula ' s innocent love , trios with Norma ' s anguish , And thy ecstatic chorus Poliuto ;) Ray ' d in the limpid yellow slanting sundown , Music , Italian music in Dakota .
It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman ' s , I sit low in a straw - bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson ' s stockings .
O dear to me my birth - things -- all moving things and the trees where I was born -- the grains , plants , rivers , Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow , distant , over flats of slivery sands or through swamps , Dear to me the Roanoke , the Savannah , the Altamahaw , the Pedee , the Tombigbee , the Santee , the Coosa and the Sabine , O pensive , far away wandering , I return with my soul to haunt their banks again , Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes , I float on the Okeechobee , I cross the hummock - land or through pleasant openings or dense forests , I see the parrots in the woods , I see the papaw - tree and the blossoming titi ; Again , sailing in my coaster on deck , I coast off Georgia , I coast up the Carolinas , I see where the live - oak is growing , I see where the yellow - pine , the scented bay - tree , the lemon and orange , the cypress , the graceful palmetto , I pass rude sea - headlands and enter Pamlico sound through an inlet , and dart my vision inland ; O the cotton plant !
Apple orchards , the trees all cover ' d with blossoms ; Wheat fields carpeted far and near in vital emerald green ; The eternal , exhaustless freshness of each early morning ; The yellow , golden , transparent haze of the warm afternoon sun ; The aspiring lilac bushes with profuse purple or white flowers .
Thou shalt perceive the simple shows , the delicate miracles of earth , Dandelions , clover , the emerald grass , the early scents and flowers , The arbutus under foot , the willow ' s yellow - green , the blossoming plum and cherry ; With these the robin , lark and thrush , singing their songs -- the flitting bluebird ; For such the scenes the annual play brings on .
Somehow I cannot let it go yet , funeral though it is , Let it remain back there on its nail suspended , With pink , blue , yellow , all blanch ' d , and the white now gray and ashy , One wither ' d rose put years ago for thee , dear friend ; But I do not forget thee .
