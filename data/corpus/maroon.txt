The streets themselves and the facades of houses , and goods in the windows , Vehicles , teams , the heavy - plank ' d wharves , the huge crossing at the ferries , The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset , the river between , Shadows , aureola and mist , the light falling on roofs and gables of white or brown two miles off , The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide , the little boat slack - tow ' d astern , The hurrying tumbling waves , quick - broken crests , slapping , The strata of color ' d clouds , the long bar of maroon - tint away solitary by itself , the spread of purity it lies motionless in , The horizon ' s edge , the flying sea - crow , the fragrance of salt marsh and shore mud , These became part of that child who went forth every day , and who now goes , and will always go forth every day .
Shot gold , maroon and violet , dazzling silver , emerald , fawn , The earth ' s whole amplitude and Nature ' s multiform power consign ' d for once to colors ; The light , the general air possess ' d by them -- colors till now unknown , No limit , confine -- not the Western sky alone -- the high meridian -- North , South , all , Pure luminous color fighting the silent shadows to the last .
