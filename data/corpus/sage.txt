Spontaneous me , Nature , The loving day , the mounting sun , the friend I am happy with , The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder , The hillside whiten ' d with blossoms of the mountain ash , The same late in autumn , the hues of red , yellow , drab , purple , and light and dark green , The rich coverlet of the grass , animals and birds , the private untrimm ' d bank , the primitive apples , the pebble - stones , Beautiful dripping fragments , the negligent list of one after another as I happen to call them to me or think of them , The real poems , ( what we call poems being merely pictures ,) The poems of the privacy of the night , and of men like me , This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry , and that all men carry , ( Know once for all , avow ' d on purpose , wherever are men like me , are our lusty lurking masculine poems ,) Love - thoughts , love - juice , love - odor , love - yielding , love - climbers , and the climbing sap , Arms and hands of love , lips of love , phallic thumb of love , breasts of love , bellies press ' d and glued together with love , Earth of chaste love , life that is only life after love , The body of my love , the body of the woman I love , the body of the man , the body of the earth , Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south - west , The hairy wild - bee that murmurs and hankers up and down , that gripes the full - grown lady - flower , curves upon her with amorous firm legs , takes his will of her , and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied ; The wet of woods through the early hours , Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep , one with an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other , The smell of apples , aromas from crush ' d sage - plant , mint , birch - bark , The boy ' s longings , the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming , The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content to the ground , The no - form ' d stings that sights , people , objects , sting me with , The hubb ' d sting of myself , stinging me as much as it ever can any one , The sensitive , orbic , underlapp ' d brothers , that only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are , The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body , the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves , The limpid liquid within the young man , The vex ' d corrosion so pensive and so painful , The torment , the irritable tide that will not be at rest , The like of the same I feel , the like of the same in others , The young man that flushes and flushes , and the young woman that flushes and flushes , The young man that wakes deep at night , the hot hand seeking to repress what would master him , The mystic amorous night , the strange half - welcome pangs , visions , sweats , The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers , the young man all color ' d , red , ashamed , angry ; The souse upon me of my lover the sea , as I lie willing and naked , The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun , the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them , The walnut - trunk , the walnut - husks , and the ripening or ripen ' d long - round walnuts , The continence of vegetables , birds , animals , The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent , while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent , The great chastity of paternity , to match the great chastity of maternity , The oath of procreation I have sworn , my Adamic and fresh daughters , The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw , till I saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through , The wholesome relief , repose , content , And this bunch pluck ' d at random from myself , It has done its work -- I toss it carelessly to fall where it may .
Facing west from California ' s shores , Inquiring , tireless , seeking what is yet unfound , I , a child , very old , over waves , towards the house of maternity , the land of migrations , look afar , Look off the shores of my Western sea , the circle almost circled ; For starting westward from Hindustan , from the vales of Kashmere , From Asia , from the north , from the God , the sage , and the hero , From the south , from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands , Long having wander ' d since , round the earth having wander ' d , Now I face home again , very pleas ' d and joyous , ( But where is what I started for so long ago ?
Collecting I traverse the garden the world , but soon I pass the gates , Now along the pond - side , now wading in a little , fearing not the wet , Now by the post - and - rail fences where the old stones thrown there , pick ' d from the fields , have accumulated , ( Wild - flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and partly cover them , beyond these I pass ,) Far , far in the forest , or sauntering later in summer , before I think where I go , Solitary , smelling the earthy smell , stopping now and then in the silence , Alone I had thought , yet soon a troop gathers around me , Some walk by my side and some behind , and some embrace my arms or neck , They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive , thicker they come , a great crowd , and I in the middle , Collecting , dispensing , singing , there I wander with them , Plucking something for tokens , tossing toward whoever is near me , Here , lilac , with a branch of pine , Here , out of my pocket , some moss which I pull ' d off a live - oak in Florida as it hung trailing down , Here , some pinks and laurel leaves , and a handful of sage , And here what I now draw from the water , wading in the pondside , ( O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me , and returns again never to separate from me , And this , O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades , this calamus - root shall , Interchange it youths with each other !
In one again , different , ( yet thine , all thine , O soul , the same ,) I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier , I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying freight and passengers , I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring , and the shrill steam - whistle , I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world , I cross the Laramie plains , I note the rocks in grotesque shapes , the buttes , I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions , the barren , colorless , sage - deserts , I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great mountains , I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains , I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle ' s Nest , I pass the Promontory , I ascend the Nevadas , I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base , I see the Humboldt range , I thread the valley and cross the river , I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe , I see forests of majestic pines , Or crossing the great desert , the alkaline plains , I behold enchanting mirages of waters and meadows , Marking through these and after all , in duplicate slender lines , Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel , Tying the Eastern to the Western sea , The road between Europe and Asia .
