" Then I take it for granted ," observed Sir Walter , " that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery ."
So one day , the little old woman made a boy out of gingerbread ; she made him a chocolate jacket , and put raisins on it for buttons ; his eyes were made of fine , fat currants ; his mouth was made of rose - coloured sugar ; and he had a gay little cap of orange sugar - candy .
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ' ORANGE MARMALADE ', but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .
It was of that innocent lonely yellow which has never heard of orange , though it might turn quite unconsciously into green .
The astronomers are always telling us that it is shaped like an orange , or like an egg , or like a German sausage .
THE great Muscari , most original of the young Tuscan poets , walked swiftly into his favourite restaurant , which overlooked the Mediterranean , was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon and orange trees .
His colour was curiously attractive , while partly tropical ; it reminded one vaguely of a blood - orange .
Susan had now poured the broth into a basin , and as she strewed over it the bright orange marigolds , it looked very tempting .
" Mr . Mansfield , Oppidan , white , purple , and orange dress , trimmed with silver ; rich satin bag , purple and silver : each carrying elegant poles , with gold and silver cord .
But , in my humble opinion , ma ' m , the marshal ' s white and purple and orange fancy dress , trimmed with silver , will bear the bell ; though , indeed , I shouldn ' t say that ,-- for the colonel ' s and lieutenant ' s , and ensign ' s , are beautiful in the extreme .
So I am , and just stepped away to suck an orange for my voice --( sucks an orange .)
" As I was sent with a message , by the clerk of our parish , to Redland chapel out on the Downs , to - day , sir ," said he to Mr . Gresham , " knowing your house lay in my way , my mother , sir , bid me call , and make bold to offer the young gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked for them ," continued the lad , pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls worked in green and orange - coloured stripes .
Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it .
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange .
By the city ' s quadrangular houses -- in log huts , camping with lumber - men , Along the ruts of the turnpike , along the dry gulch and rivulet bed , Weeding my onion - patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips , crossing savannas , trailing in forests , Prospecting , gold - digging , girdling the trees of a new purchase , Scorch ' d ankle - deep by the hot sand , hauling my boat down the shallow river , Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead , where the buck turns furiously at the hunter , Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock , where the otter is feeding on fish , Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou , Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey , where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle - shaped tall ; Over the growing sugar , over the yellow - flower ' d cotton plant , over the rice in its low moist field , Over the sharp - peak ' d farm house , with its scallop ' d scum and slender shoots from the gutters , Over the western persimmon , over the long - leav ' d corn , over the delicate blue - flower flax , Over the white and brown buckwheat , a hummer and buzzer there with the rest , Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze ; Scaling mountains , pulling myself cautiously up , holding on by low scragged limbs , Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush , Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat - lot , Where the bat flies in the Seventh - month eve , where the great goldbug drops through the dark , Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow , Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides , Where the cheese - cloth hangs in the kitchen , where andirons straddle the hearth - slab , where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters ; Where trip - hammers crash , where the press is whirling its cylinders , Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs , Where the pear - shaped balloon is floating aloft , ( floating in it myself and looking composedly down ,) Where the life - car is drawn on the slip - noose , where the heat hatches pale - green eggs in the dented sand , Where the she - whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it , Where the steam - ship trails hind - ways its long pennant of smoke , Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water , Where the half - burn ' d brig is riding on unknown currents , Where shells grow to her slimy deck , where the dead are corrupting below ; Where the dense - starr ' d flag is borne at the head of the regiments , Approaching Manhattan up by the long - stretching island , Under Niagara , the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance , Upon a door - step , upon the horse - block of hard wood outside , Upon the race - course , or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base - ball , At he - festivals , with blackguard gibes , ironical license , bull - dances , drinking , laughter , At the cider - mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash , sucking the juice through a straw , At apple - peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find , At musters , beach - parties , friendly bees , huskings , house - raisings ; Where the mocking - bird sounds his delicious gurgles , cackles , screams , weeps , Where the hay - rick stands in the barn - yard , where the dry - stalks are scatter ' d , where the brood - cow waits in the hovel , Where the bull advances to do his masculine work , where the stud to the mare , where the cock is treading the hen , Where the heifers browse , where geese nip their food with short jerks , Where sun - down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie , Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near , Where the humming - bird shimmers , where the neck of the long - lived swan is curving and winding , Where the laughing - gull scoots by the shore , where she laughs her near - human laugh , Where bee - hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds , Where band - neck ' d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out , Where burial coaches enter the arch ' d gates of a cemetery , Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees , Where the yellow - crown ' d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs , Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon , Where the katy - did works her chromatic reed on the walnut - tree over the well , Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver - wired leaves , Through the salt - lick or orange glade , or under conical firs , Through the gymnasium , through the curtain ' d saloon , through the office or public hall ; Pleas ' d with the native and pleas ' d with the foreign , pleas ' d with the new and old , Pleas ' d with the homely woman as well as the handsome , Pleas ' d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously , Pleas ' d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash ' d church , Pleas ' d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher , impress ' d seriously at the camp - meeting ; Looking in at the shop - windows of Broadway the whole forenoon , flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass , Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn ' d up to the clouds , or down a lane or along the beach , My right and left arms round the sides of two friends , and I in the middle ; Coming home with the silent and dark - cheek ' d bush - boy , ( behind me he rides at the drape of the day ,) Far from the settlements studying the print of animals ' feet , or the moccasin print , By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient , Nigh the coffin ' d corpse when all is still , examining with a candle ; Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure , Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any , Hot toward one I hate , ready in my madness to knife him , Solitary at midnight in my back yard , my thoughts gone from me a long while , Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side , Speeding through space , speeding through heaven and the stars , Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring , and the diameter of eighty thousand miles , Speeding with tail ' d meteors , throwing fire - balls like the rest , Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly , Storming , enjoying , planning , loving , cautioning , Backing and filling , appearing and disappearing , I tread day and night such roads .
And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut , And stems of currants and plum - blows , and the aromatic cedar , These I compass ' d around by a thick cloud of spirits , Wandering , point to or touch as I pass , or throw them loosely from me , Indicating to each one what he shall have , giving something to each ; But what I drew from the water by the pond - side , that I reserve , I will give of it , but only to them that love as I myself am capable of loving .
Of them standing among them , one lifts to the light a west - bred face , To him the hereditary countenance bequeath ' d both mother ' s and father ' s , His first parts substances , earth , water , animals , trees , Built of the common stock , having room for far and near , Used to dispense with other lands , incarnating this land , Attracting it body and soul to himself , hanging on its neck with incomparable love , Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits , Making its cities , beginnings , events , diversities , wars , vocal in him , Making its rivers , lakes , bays , embouchure in him , Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes , Columbia , Niagara , Hudson , spending themselves lovingly in him , If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch , he stretching with them North or South , Spanning between them East and West , and touching whatever is between them , Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine , cedar , hemlock , live - oak , locust , chestnut , hickory , cottonwood , orange , magnolia , Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp , He likening sides and peaks of mountains , forests coated with northern transparent ice , Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna , upland , prairie , Through him flights , whirls , screams , answering those of the fish - hawk , mocking - bird , night - heron , and eagle , His spirit surrounding his country ' s spirit , unclosed to good and evil , Surrounding the essences of real things , old times and present times , Surrounding just found shores , islands , tribes of red aborigines , Weather - beaten vessels , landings , settlements , embryo stature and muscle , The haughty defiance of the Year One , war , peace , the formation of the Constitution , The separate States , the simple elastic scheme , the immigrants , The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable , The unsurvey ' d interior , log - houses , clearings , wild animals , hunters , trappers , Surrounding the multiform agriculture , mines , temperature , the gestation of new States , Congress convening every Twelfth - month , the members duly coming up from the uttermost parts , Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers , especially the young men , Responding their manners , speech , dress , friendships , the gait they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors , The freshness and candor of their physiognomy , the copiousness and decision of their phrenology , The picturesque looseness of their carriage , their fierceness when wrong ' d , The fluency of their speech , their delight in music , their curiosity , good temper and open - handedness , the whole composite make , The prevailing ardor and enterprise , the large amativeness , The perfect equality of the female with the male , the fluid movement of the population , The superior marine , free commerce , fisheries , whaling , gold - digging , Wharf - hemm ' d cities , railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points , Factories , mercantile life , labor - saving machinery , the Northeast , Northwest , Southwest , Manhattan firemen , the Yankee swap , southern plantation life , Slavery -- the murderous , treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the rest , On and on to the grapple with it -- Assassin !
That the winds are really not infectious , That this is no cheat , this transparent green - wash of the sea which is so amorous after me , That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues , That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves in it , That all is clean forever and forever , That the cool drink from the well tastes so good , That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy , That the fruits of the apple - orchard and the orange - orchard , that melons , grapes , peaches , plums , will none of them poison me , That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease , Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once catching disease .
O dear to me my birth - things -- all moving things and the trees where I was born -- the grains , plants , rivers , Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow , distant , over flats of slivery sands or through swamps , Dear to me the Roanoke , the Savannah , the Altamahaw , the Pedee , the Tombigbee , the Santee , the Coosa and the Sabine , O pensive , far away wandering , I return with my soul to haunt their banks again , Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes , I float on the Okeechobee , I cross the hummock - land or through pleasant openings or dense forests , I see the parrots in the woods , I see the papaw - tree and the blossoming titi ; Again , sailing in my coaster on deck , I coast off Georgia , I coast up the Carolinas , I see where the live - oak is growing , I see where the yellow - pine , the scented bay - tree , the lemon and orange , the cypress , the graceful palmetto , I pass rude sea - headlands and enter Pamlico sound through an inlet , and dart my vision inland ; O the cotton plant !
