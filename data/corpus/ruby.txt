And her breast did lick And upon her neck , From his eyes of flame , Ruby tears there came ;
Across the great plains and uplands to the right and left of the lane , a long tide of sunset light rolled like a sea of ruby , lighting up the long terraces of the hills and picking out the few windows of the scattered hamlets in startling blood - red sparks .
Though the white vapour was still a veil , it was like the gauzy veil of a transformation scene in a pantomime ; for through it there glowed shapeless masses of colour , masses which might be clouds of sunrise or mosaics of gold and crimson , or ladies robed in ruby and emerald draperies .
But on them as they swept upward better and braver winds seemed to blow , and on them the ruby light of evening seemed struck , and splashed like red spurts from the grapes of Dionysus .
There was a great red sunset ; and the long stretch of low water , hardly rising over the ankle for half a mile , was like a lake of ruby flame .
The place he found beyond expression bright , Compared with aught on earth , metal or stone ; Not all parts like , but all alike informed With radiant light , as glowing iron with fire ; If metal , part seemed gold , part silver clear ; If stone , carbuncle most or chrysolite , Ruby or topaz , to the twelve that shone In Aaron ' s breast - plate , and a stone besides Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen , That stone , or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought , In vain , though by their powerful art they bind Volatile Hermes , and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the sea , Drained through a limbeck to his native form .
Ouer thy wounds , now do I Prophesie , ( Which like dumbe mouthes do ope their Ruby lips , To begge the voyce and vtterance of my Tongue ) A Curse shall light vpon the limbes of men ; Domesticke Fury , and fierce Ciuill strife , Shall cumber all the parts of Italy : Blood and destruction shall be so in vse , And dreadfull Obiects so familiar , That Mothers shall but smile , when they behold Their Infants quartered with the hands of Warre : All pitty choak ' d with custome of fell deeds , And Caesars Spirit ranging for Reuenge , With Ate by his side , come hot from Hell , Shall in these Confines , with a Monarkes voyce , Cry hauocke , and let slip the Dogges of Warre , That this foule deede , shall smell aboue the earth With Carrion men , groaning for Buriall .
