Over the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural discoloration , as of that disastrous twilight which Milton spoke of as shed by the sun in eclipse ; so that Syme fell easily into his first thought , that he was actually on some other and emptier planet , which circled round some sadder star .
His form had yet not lost All her original brightness , nor appeared Less than Archangel ruined , and th ' excess Of glory obscured : as when the sun new - risen Looks through the horizontal misty air Shorn of his beams , or , from behind the moon , In dim eclipse , disastrous twilight sheds On half the nations , and with fear of change Perplexes monarchs .
So saying he dismissed them ; they with speed Their course through thickest constellations held , Spreading their bane ; the blasted stars looked wan , And planets , planet - struck , real eclipse Then suffered .
