And the Diamond sparkled and gleamed with vivid , violet flashes , so that the Beetle was glad to shade his eyes .
The masses of rose or rhododendron deepened from crimson to violet .
Against it the tops , one might say the turrets , of the clipt and ordered trees were outlined in that shade of veiled violet which tints the tops of lavender .
When the other two men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags , he agreed with them .
The trampled earth of the river - banks and the peaty stain in the pools did not look drab but glowing umber , and the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look , as usual , dim blue with mere depth of distance , but more like wind - tumbled masses of some vivid violet blossom .
The line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of its violet - blue , like the vein of a frozen finger .
The little pink clouds , that looked rather like sweet - stuff , had floated up to crown the turrets of the gilt gingerbread castle , and the pink baby fingers of the budding trees seemed spreading and stretching to reach them ; the blue sky began to take a bright violet of evening , when Father Brown suddenly spoke again :
Across the great part of the dome they were grey , with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green ; but towards the west the whole grew past description , transparent and passionate , and the last red - hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen .
With a sharp gesture he motioned them to silence , but he pointed with one gloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the Marquis de St . Eustache , his teeth shining in his thick , black beard , and his bold , brown face shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea .
He was clad in a fine but old - fashioned suit with knee - breeches ; its colour was that shade between blue , violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland .
" Show us the place ," Syme said briefly , and without a word the man in the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the hedge , which let in suddenly the light of a white road .
" Mr . Tomkins , violet and silver ; helmet .

Thus talking , hand in hand alone they passed On to their blissful bower : it was a place Chosen by the sovran Planter , when he framed All things to Man ' s delightful use ; the roof Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and myrtle , and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf ; on either side Acanthus , and each odorous bushy shrub , Fenced up the verdant wall ; each beauteous flower , Iris all hues , roses , and jessamin , Reared high their flourished heads between , and wrought Mosaick ; underfoot the violet , Crocus , and hyacinth , with rich inlay Broidered the ground , more coloured than with stone Of costliest emblem : Other creature here , Bird , beast , insect , or worm , durst enter none , Such was their awe of Man .
For Hamlet , and the trifling of his fauours , Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude ; A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature ; Froward , not permanent ; sweet not lasting The suppliance of a minute ?
I believe in those wing ' d purposes , And acknowledge red , yellow , white , playing within me , And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional , And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else , And the in the woods never studied the gamut , yet trills pretty well to me , And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me .
I too many and many a time cross ' d the river of old , Watched the Twelfth - month sea - gulls , saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings , oscillating their bodies , Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow , Saw the slow - wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south , Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water , Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams , Look ' d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water , Look ' d on the haze on the hills southward and south - westward , Look ' d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet , Look ' d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving , Saw their approach , saw aboard those that were near me , Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops , saw the ships at anchor , The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars , The round masts , the swinging motion of the hulls , the slender serpentine pennants , The large and small steamers in motion , the pilots in their pilothouses , The white wake left by the passage , the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels , The flags of all nations , the falling of them at sunset , The scallop - edged waves in the twilight , the ladled cups , the frolic - some crests and glistening , The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer , the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks , On the river the shadowy group , the big steam - tug closely flank ' d on each side by the barges , the hay - boat , the belated lighter , On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night , Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses , and down into the clefts of streets .
Lo , the most excellent sun so calm and haughty , The violet and purple morn with just - felt breezes , The gentle soft - born measureless light , The miracle spreading bathing all , the fulfill ' d noon , The coming eve delicious , the welcome night and the stars , Over my cities shining all , enveloping man and land .
Shot gold , maroon and violet , dazzling silver , emerald , fawn , The earth ' s whole amplitude and Nature ' s multiform power consign ' d for once to colors ; The light , the general air possess ' d by them -- colors till now unknown , No limit , confine -- not the Western sky alone -- the high meridian -- North , South , all , Pure luminous color fighting the silent shadows to the last .
