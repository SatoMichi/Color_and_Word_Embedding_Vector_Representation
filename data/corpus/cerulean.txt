Far , far at sea , After the night ' s fierce drifts have strewn the shore with wrecks , With re - appearing day as now so happy and serene , The rosy and elastic dawn , the flashing sun , The limpid spread of air cerulean , Thou also re - appearest .
Flag cerulean -- sunny flag , with the orbs of night dappled !
2 Ever upon this stage , Is acted God ' s calm annual drama , Gorgeous processions , songs of birds , Sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul , The heaving sea , the waves upon the shore , the musical , strong waves , The woods , the stalwart trees , the slender , tapering trees , The liliput countless armies of the grass , The heat , the showers , the measureless pasturages , The scenery of the snows , the winds ' free orchestra , The stretching light - hung roof of clouds , the clear cerulean and the silvery fringes , The high - dilating stars , the placid beckoning stars , The moving flocks and herds , the plains and emerald meadows , The shows of all the varied lands and all the growths and products .
Warble me now for joy of lilac - time , ( returning in reminiscence ,) Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature ' s sake , souvenirs of earliest summer , Gather the welcome signs , ( as children with pebbles or stringing shells ,) Put in April and May , the hylas croaking in the ponds , the elastic air , Bees , butterflies , the sparrow with its simple notes , Blue - bird and darting swallow , nor forget the high - hole flashing his golden wings , The tranquil sunny haze , the clinging smoke , the vapor , Shimmer of waters with fish in them , the cerulean above , All that is jocund and sparkling , the brooks running , The maple woods , the crisp February days and the sugar - making , The robin where he hops , bright - eyed , brown - breasted , With musical clear call at sunrise , and again at sunset , Or flitting among the trees of the apple - orchard , building the nest of his mate , The melted snow of March , the willow sending forth its yellow - green sprouts , For spring - time is here !
