His lank limbs were clad , I might also say clutched , in very tight grey sleeves and pantaloons ; he had a long , sallow , aquiline face which seemed somehow all the more saturnine because his lantern jaws were imprisoned in his collar and neck - cloth more in the style of the old stock ; and his hair ( which ought to have been dark brown ) was of an odd dim , russet colour which , in conjunction with his yellow face , looked rather purple than red .
But looke , the Morne in Russet mantle clad , Walkes o ' re the dew of yon high Easterne Hill , Breake we our Watch vp , and by my aduice Let vs impart what we haue seene to night Vnto yong Hamlet .
Down on the ancient wharf , the sand , I sit , with a new - comer chatting : He shipp ' d as green - hand boy , and sail ' d away , ( took some sudden , vehement notion ;) Since , twenty years and more have circled round and round , While he the globe was circling round and round , -- and now returns : How changed the place -- all the old land - marks gone -- the parents dead ; ( Yes , he comes back to lay in port for good -- to settle -- has a well - fill ' d purse -- no spot will do but this ;) The little boat that scull ' d him from the sloop , now held in leash I see , I hear the slapping waves , the restless keel , the rocking in the sand , I see the sailor kit , the canvas bag , the great box bound with brass , I scan the face all berry - brown and bearded -- the stout - strong frame , Dress ' d in its russet suit of good Scotch cloth : ( Then what the told - out story of those twenty years ?
