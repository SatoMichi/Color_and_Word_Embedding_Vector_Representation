24 : 9 Then went up Moses , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel : 24 : 10 And they saw the God of Israel : and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone , and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness .
28 : 18 And the second row shall be an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
39 : 11 And the second row , an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
28 : 16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
4 : 7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk , they were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was of sapphire : 4 : 8 Their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cleaveth to their bones ; it is withered , it is become like a stick .
1 : 26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
10 : 1 Then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
28 : 13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God ; every precious stone was thy covering , the sardius , topaz , and the diamond , the beryl , the onyx , and the jasper , the sapphire , the emerald , and the carbuncle , and gold : the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created .
The first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , a chalcedony ; the fourth , an emerald ; 21 : 20 The fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolyte ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , a topaz ; the tenth , a chrysoprasus ; the eleventh , a jacinth ; the twelfth , an amethyst .
All eyes , as usual , were riveted , for the moment at least , upon Ethel Harrogate , whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea , like a goddess ' s .
Here Nature first begins Her farthest verge , and Chaos to retire , As from her outmost works , a broken foe , With tumult less and with less hostile din ; That Satan with less toil , and now with ease , Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light , And , like a weather - beaten vessel , holds Gladly the port , though shrouds and tackle torn ; Or in the emptier waste , resembling air , Weighs his spread wings , at leisure to behold Far off th ' empyreal Heaven , extended wide In circuit , undetermined square or round , With opal towers and battlements adorned Of living sapphire , once his native seat ; And , fast by , hanging in a golden chain , This pendent World , in bigness as a star Of smallest magnitude close by the moon .
Beneath him with new wonder now he views , To all delight of human sense exposed , In narrow room , Nature ' s whole wealth , yea more , A Heaven on Earth : For blissful Paradise Of God the garden was , by him in the east Of Eden planted ; Eden stretched her line From Auran eastward to the royal towers Of great Seleucia , built by Grecian kings , Of where the sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar : In this pleasant soil His far more pleasant garden God ordained ; Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow All trees of noblest kind for sight , smell , taste ; And all amid them stood the tree of life , High eminent , blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold ; and next to life , Our death , the tree of knowledge , grew fast by , Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill . Southward through Eden went a river large , Nor changed his course , but through the shaggy hill Passed underneath ingulfed ; for God had thrown That mountain as his garden - mould high raised Upon the rapid current , which , through veins Of porous earth with kindly thirst up - drawn , Rose a fresh fountain , and with many a rill Watered the garden ; thence united fell Down the steep glade , and met the nether flood , Which from his darksome passage now appears , And now , divided into four main streams , Runs diverse , wandering many a famous realm And country , whereof here needs no account ; But rather to tell how , if Art could tell , How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks , Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold , With mazy errour under pendant shades Ran nectar , visiting each plant , and fed Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice Art In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon Poured forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain , Both where the morning sun first warmly smote The open field , and where the unpierced shade Imbrowned the noontide bowers : Thus was this place A happy rural seat of various view ; Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm , Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true , If true , here only , and of delicious taste : Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb , were interposed , Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store , Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose : Another side , umbrageous grots and caves Of cool recess , o ' er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake , That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams .
Forth rushed with whirlwind sound The chariot of Paternal Deity , Flashing thick flames , wheel within wheel undrawn , Itself instinct with Spirit , but convoyed By four Cherubick shapes ; four faces each Had wonderous ; as with stars , their bodies all And wings were set with eyes ; with eyes the wheels Of beryl , and careering fires between ; Over their heads a crystal firmament , Whereon a sapphire throne , inlaid with pure Amber , and colours of the showery arch .
He , in celestial panoply all armed Of radiant Urim , work divinely wrought , Ascended ; at his right hand Victory Sat eagle - winged ; beside him hung his bow And quiver with three - bolted thunder stored ; And from about him fierce effusion rolled Of smoke , and bickering flame , and sparkles dire : Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints , He onward came ; far off his coming shone ; And twenty thousand ( I their number heard ) Chariots of God , half on each hand , were seen ; He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime On the crystalline sky , in sapphire throned , Illustrious far and wide ; but by his own First seen : Them unexpected joy surprised , When the great ensign of Messiah blazed Aloft by Angels borne , his sign in Heaven ; Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced His army , circumfused on either wing , Under their Head imbodied all in one .
