And a song , consisting of an unimaginable number of verses , in which his name was rhymed with flat iron , the British Lion , sly ' un , dandelion , Spion ( With Kop in the next line ), was sung to crowded houses every night .
Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ?
} The First Dandelion
Simple and fresh and fair from winter ' s close emerging , As if no artifice of fashion , business , politics , had ever been , Forth from its sunny nook of shelter ' d grass -- innocent , golden , calm as the dawn , The spring ' s first dandelion shows its trustful face .
