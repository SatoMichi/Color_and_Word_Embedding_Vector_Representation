So one day , the little old woman made a boy out of gingerbread ; she made him a chocolate jacket , and put raisins on it for buttons ; his eyes were made of fine , fat currants ; his mouth was made of rose - coloured sugar ; and he had a gay little cap of orange sugar - candy .
Some provisions they had bought last night , at a low public house , in case of undefined contingencies , were tossed about like the materials of an ordinary picnic , here a basket of chocolate , and there a bottle of wine .
You have the chocolate , I think ?
It may be easier to get chocolate for nothing out of a shopkeeper than out of an automatic machine .
But if you did manage to steal the chocolate , the automatic machine would be much less likely to run after you .
But master has not had his chocolate , ma ' am .
He won ' t ever see anybody before he drinks his chocolate , you know , ma ' am .
( He appears in his nightgown and cap , with his gouty foot upon a stool -- a table and chocolate beside him -- Lucy is leaning on the arm of his chair .)
Whilst you are drinking your chocolate , papa ?
No , no , no -- I never see anybody till I have done my chocolate , darling .
( He tastes his chocolate .)
Don ' t you know , child , I never see anybody till I ' ve drunk my chocolate ; and I never will , if it were a duke -- that ' s poz !
Well , well , well ( finishing his cup of chocolate , and pushing his dish away ); and at anyrate there was not sugar enough .
Enter William , to take away the chocolate .
Oh , darling , YOU shall contradict me as often as you please -- only not before I ' ve drunk my chocolate , child -- hey !
