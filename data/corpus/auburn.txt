But though she was not yet middle - aged and her auburn hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour , there was a look in her mouth and around her eyes which suggested that some sorrows wasted her , as winds waste at last the edges of a Greek temple .
That young man with the long , auburn hair and the impudent face -- that young man was not really a poet ; but surely he was a poem .
And this was strongest of all on one particular evening , still vaguely remembered in the locality , of which the auburn - haired poet was the hero .
They formed the most beautiful gradation of colours , from the palest auburn to the brightest black .
