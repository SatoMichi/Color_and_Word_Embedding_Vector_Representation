8 : 14 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month : 8 : 15 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities , and in Jerusalem , saying , Go forth unto the mount , and fetch olive branches , and pine branches , and myrtle branches , and palm branches , and branches of thick trees , to make booths , as it is written .
41 : 19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar , the shittah tree , and the myrtle , and the oil tree ; I will set in the desert the fir tree , and the pine , and the box tree together : 41 : 20 That they may see , and know , and consider , and understand together , that the hand of the LORD hath done this , and the Holy One of Israel hath created it .
55 : 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to the LORD for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off .
1 : 7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Sebat , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying , 1 : 8 I saw by night , and behold a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , speckled , and white .
1 : 10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said , These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth .
1 : 11 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees , and said , We have walked to and fro through the earth , and , behold , all the earth sitteth still , and is at rest .
There is to be a wreath of myrtle , you know , round the handle , and a frost ground , and then the medallions --"
said she , with increased vehemence , when , after drawing aside the veil of silver paper , she saw him grasp the myrtle wreathed handle .
I ' m afraid this poor myrtle is quite dead -- quite dead .
Beneath him with new wonder now he views , To all delight of human sense exposed , In narrow room , Nature ' s whole wealth , yea more , A Heaven on Earth : For blissful Paradise Of God the garden was , by him in the east Of Eden planted ; Eden stretched her line From Auran eastward to the royal towers Of great Seleucia , built by Grecian kings , Of where the sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar : In this pleasant soil His far more pleasant garden God ordained ; Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow All trees of noblest kind for sight , smell , taste ; And all amid them stood the tree of life , High eminent , blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold ; and next to life , Our death , the tree of knowledge , grew fast by , Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill . Southward through Eden went a river large , Nor changed his course , but through the shaggy hill Passed underneath ingulfed ; for God had thrown That mountain as his garden - mould high raised Upon the rapid current , which , through veins Of porous earth with kindly thirst up - drawn , Rose a fresh fountain , and with many a rill Watered the garden ; thence united fell Down the steep glade , and met the nether flood , Which from his darksome passage now appears , And now , divided into four main streams , Runs diverse , wandering many a famous realm And country , whereof here needs no account ; But rather to tell how , if Art could tell , How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks , Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold , With mazy errour under pendant shades Ran nectar , visiting each plant , and fed Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice Art In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon Poured forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain , Both where the morning sun first warmly smote The open field , and where the unpierced shade Imbrowned the noontide bowers : Thus was this place A happy rural seat of various view ; Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm , Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true , If true , here only , and of delicious taste : Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb , were interposed , Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store , Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose : Another side , umbrageous grots and caves Of cool recess , o ' er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake , That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams .
Thus talking , hand in hand alone they passed On to their blissful bower : it was a place Chosen by the sovran Planter , when he framed All things to Man ' s delightful use ; the roof Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and myrtle , and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf ; on either side Acanthus , and each odorous bushy shrub , Fenced up the verdant wall ; each beauteous flower , Iris all hues , roses , and jessamin , Reared high their flourished heads between , and wrought Mosaick ; underfoot the violet , Crocus , and hyacinth , with rich inlay Broidered the ground , more coloured than with stone Of costliest emblem : Other creature here , Bird , beast , insect , or worm , durst enter none , Such was their awe of Man .
Thou therefore now advise , Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present : Let us divide our labours ; thou , where choice Leads thee , or where most needs , whether to wind The woodbine round this arbour , or direct The clasping ivy where to climb ; while I , In yonder spring of roses intermixed With myrtle , find what to redress till noon : For , while so near each other thus all day Our task we choose , what wonder if so near Looks intervene and smiles , or object new Casual discourse draw on ; which intermits Our day ' s work , brought to little , though begun Early , and the hour of supper comes unearned ?
In bower and field he sought , where any tuft Of grove or garden - plot more pleasant lay , Their tendance , or plantation for delight ; By fountain or by shady rivulet He sought them both , but wished his hap might find Eve separate ; he wished , but not with hope Of what so seldom chanced ; when to his wish , Beyond his hope , Eve separate he spies , Veiled in a cloud of fragrance , where she stood , Half spied , so thick the roses blushing round About her glowed , oft stooping to support Each flower of slender stalk , whose head , though gay Carnation , purple , azure , or specked with gold , Hung drooping unsustained ; them she upstays Gently with myrtle band , mindless the while Herself , though fairest unsupported flower , From her best prop so far , and storm so nigh .
