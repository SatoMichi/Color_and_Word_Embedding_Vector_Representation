They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of " Men ' s Beavers " and " York Tan " were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --" But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ .
Why sir , his hide is so tan ' d with his Trade , that he will keepe out water a great while .
This man was a wonderful vigor , calmness , beauty of person , The shape of his head , the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard , the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes , the richness and breadth of his manners , These I used to go and visit him to see , he was wise also , He was six feet tall , he was over eighty years old , his sons were massive , clean , bearded , tan - faced , handsome , They and his daughters loved him , all who saw him loved him , They did not love him by allowance , they loved him with personal love , He drank water only , the blood show ' d like scarlet through the clear - brown skin of his face , He was a frequent gunner and fisher , he sail ' d his boat himself , he had a fine one presented to him by a ship - joiner , he had fowling - pieces presented to him by men that loved him , When he went with his five sons and many grand - sons to hunt or fish , you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang , You would wish long and long to be with him , you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other .
Divine instinct , breadth of vision , the law of reason , health , rudeness of body , withdrawnness , Gayety , sun - tan , air - sweetness , such are some of the words of poems .
Come my tan - faced children , Follow well in order , get your weapons ready , Have you your pistols ?
} O Tan - Faced Prairie - Boy
O tan - faced prairie - boy , Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift , Praises and presents came and nourishing food , till at last among the recruits , You came , taciturn , with nothing to give -- we but look ' d on each other , When lo !
My handsome tan - faced horsemen !
