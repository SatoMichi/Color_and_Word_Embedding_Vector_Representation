She expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to Gray ' s in Sackville Street , where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old - fashioned jewels of her mother .
When they stopped at the door , Mrs . Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray ' s , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their ' s , she should pay her visit and return for them .
Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr . Gray ' s shop , as in her own bedroom .
Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr . Gray ' s shop .
Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray ' s his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs . Jennings .
In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men , the very he , who had given them a lecture on toothpick - cases at Gray ' s .
42 : 38 And he said , My son shall not go down with you ; for his brother is dead , and he is left alone : if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
44 : 27 And thy servant my father said unto us , Ye know that my wife bare me two sons : 44 : 28 And the one went out from me , and I said , Surely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since : 44 : 29 And if ye take this also from me , and mischief befall him , ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
44 : 30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad ' s life ; 44 : 31 It shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad is not with us , that he will die : and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave .
32 : 25 The sword without , and terror within , shall destroy both the young man and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray hairs .
7 : 9 Strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , yet he knoweth not .
High on the hilltop The old King sits ; He is now so old and gray , He ' s nigh lost his wits .
But Piccola never doubted at all That something beautiful must befall Every child upon Christmas - day , And so she slept till the dawn was gray .
In the Big Hickory - tree were Chatterer the Red Squirrel , Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel , and Sammy Jay .
Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and his cousin , Chatterer the Red Squirrel , looking down from another tree , held _their_ breath .
Of course , Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel were there .
Hither of ill - joined sons and daughters born First from the ancient world those giants came With many a vain exploit , though then renowned : The builders next of Babel on the plain Of Sennaar , and still with vain design , New Babels , had they wherewithal , would build : Others came single ; he , who , to be deemed A God , leaped fondly into Aetna flames , Empedocles ; and he , who , to enjoy Plato ' s Elysium , leaped into the sea , Cleombrotus ; and many more too long , Embryos , and idiots , eremites , and friars White , black , and gray , with all their trumpery .
Now came still Evening on , and Twilight gray Had in her sober livery all things clad ; Silence accompanied ; for beast and bird , They to their grassy couch , these to their nests Were slunk , all but the wakeful nightingale ; She all night long her amorous descant sung ; Silence was pleased : Now glowed the firmament With living sapphires : Hesperus , that led The starry host , rode brightest , till the moon , Rising in clouded majesty , at length Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light , And o ' er the dark her silver mantle threw .
Ye Mists and Exhalations , that now rise From hill or steaming lake , dusky or gray , Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold , In honour to the world ' s great Author rise ; Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky , Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers , Rising or falling still advance his praise .
Hither , as to their fountain , other stars Repairing , in their golden urns draw light , And hence the morning - planet gilds her horns ; By tincture or reflection they augment Their small peculiar , though from human sight So far remote , with diminution seen , First in his east the glorious lamp was seen , Regent of day , and all the horizon round Invested with bright rays , jocund to run His longitude through Heaven ' s high road ; the gray Dawn , and the Pleiades , before him danced , Shedding sweet influence : Less bright the moon , But opposite in levelled west was set , His mirrour , with full face borrowing her light From him ; for other light she needed none In that aspect , and still that distance keeps Till night ; then in the east her turn she shines , Revolved on Heaven ' s great axle , and her reign With thousand lesser lights dividual holds , With thousand thousand stars , that then appeared Spangling the hemisphere : Then first adorned With their bright luminaries that set and rose , Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day .
There is , said Michael , if thou well observe The rule of Not too much ; by temperance taught , In what thou eatest and drinkest ; seeking from thence Due nourishment , not gluttonous delight , Till many years over thy head return : So mayest thou live ; till , like ripe fruit , thou drop Into thy mother ' s lap ; or be with ease Gathered , nor harshly plucked ; for death mature : This is Old Age ; but then , thou must outlive Thy youth , thy strength , thy beauty ; which will change To withered , weak , and gray ; thy senses then , Obtuse , all taste of pleasure must forego , To what thou hast ; and , for the air of youth , Hopeful and cheerful , in thy blood will reign A melancholy damp of cold and dry To weigh thy spirits down , and last consume The balm of life .
In other part the sceptered heralds call To council , in the city - gates ; anon Gray - headed men and grave , with warriours mixed , Assemble , and harangues are heard ; but soon , In factious opposition ; till at last , Of middle age one rising , eminent In wise deport , spake much of right and wrong , Of justice , or religion , truth , and peace , And judgement from above : him old and young Exploded , and had seized with violent hands , Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence Unseen amid the throng : so violence Proceeded , and oppression , and sword - law , Through all the plain , and refuge none was found .
This also shall they gain by their delay In the wide wilderness ; there they shall found Their government , and their great senate choose Through the twelve tribes , to rule by laws ordained : God from the mount of Sinai , whose gray top Shall tremble , he descending , will himself In thunder , lightning , and loud trumpets ' sound , Ordain them laws ; part , such as appertain To civil justice ; part , religious rites Of sacrifice ; informing them , by types And shadows , of that destined Seed to bruise The Serpent , by what means he shall achieve Mankind ' s deliverance .

No dainty dolce affettuoso I , Bearded , sun - burnt , gray - neck ' d , forbidding , I have arrived , To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe , For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them .

Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake !
By the city ' s quadrangular houses -- in log huts , camping with lumber - men , Along the ruts of the turnpike , along the dry gulch and rivulet bed , Weeding my onion - patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips , crossing savannas , trailing in forests , Prospecting , gold - digging , girdling the trees of a new purchase , Scorch ' d ankle - deep by the hot sand , hauling my boat down the shallow river , Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead , where the buck turns furiously at the hunter , Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock , where the otter is feeding on fish , Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou , Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey , where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle - shaped tall ; Over the growing sugar , over the yellow - flower ' d cotton plant , over the rice in its low moist field , Over the sharp - peak ' d farm house , with its scallop ' d scum and slender shoots from the gutters , Over the western persimmon , over the long - leav ' d corn , over the delicate blue - flower flax , Over the white and brown buckwheat , a hummer and buzzer there with the rest , Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze ; Scaling mountains , pulling myself cautiously up , holding on by low scragged limbs , Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush , Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat - lot , Where the bat flies in the Seventh - month eve , where the great goldbug drops through the dark , Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow , Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides , Where the cheese - cloth hangs in the kitchen , where andirons straddle the hearth - slab , where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters ; Where trip - hammers crash , where the press is whirling its cylinders , Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs , Where the pear - shaped balloon is floating aloft , ( floating in it myself and looking composedly down ,) Where the life - car is drawn on the slip - noose , where the heat hatches pale - green eggs in the dented sand , Where the she - whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it , Where the steam - ship trails hind - ways its long pennant of smoke , Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water , Where the half - burn ' d brig is riding on unknown currents , Where shells grow to her slimy deck , where the dead are corrupting below ; Where the dense - starr ' d flag is borne at the head of the regiments , Approaching Manhattan up by the long - stretching island , Under Niagara , the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance , Upon a door - step , upon the horse - block of hard wood outside , Upon the race - course , or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base - ball , At he - festivals , with blackguard gibes , ironical license , bull - dances , drinking , laughter , At the cider - mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash , sucking the juice through a straw , At apple - peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find , At musters , beach - parties , friendly bees , huskings , house - raisings ; Where the mocking - bird sounds his delicious gurgles , cackles , screams , weeps , Where the hay - rick stands in the barn - yard , where the dry - stalks are scatter ' d , where the brood - cow waits in the hovel , Where the bull advances to do his masculine work , where the stud to the mare , where the cock is treading the hen , Where the heifers browse , where geese nip their food with short jerks , Where sun - down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie , Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near , Where the humming - bird shimmers , where the neck of the long - lived swan is curving and winding , Where the laughing - gull scoots by the shore , where she laughs her near - human laugh , Where bee - hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds , Where band - neck ' d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out , Where burial coaches enter the arch ' d gates of a cemetery , Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees , Where the yellow - crown ' d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs , Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon , Where the katy - did works her chromatic reed on the walnut - tree over the well , Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver - wired leaves , Through the salt - lick or orange glade , or under conical firs , Through the gymnasium , through the curtain ' d saloon , through the office or public hall ; Pleas ' d with the native and pleas ' d with the foreign , pleas ' d with the new and old , Pleas ' d with the homely woman as well as the handsome , Pleas ' d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously , Pleas ' d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash ' d church , Pleas ' d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher , impress ' d seriously at the camp - meeting ; Looking in at the shop - windows of Broadway the whole forenoon , flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass , Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn ' d up to the clouds , or down a lane or along the beach , My right and left arms round the sides of two friends , and I in the middle ; Coming home with the silent and dark - cheek ' d bush - boy , ( behind me he rides at the drape of the day ,) Far from the settlements studying the print of animals ' feet , or the moccasin print , By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient , Nigh the coffin ' d corpse when all is still , examining with a candle ; Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure , Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any , Hot toward one I hate , ready in my madness to knife him , Solitary at midnight in my back yard , my thoughts gone from me a long while , Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side , Speeding through space , speeding through heaven and the stars , Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring , and the diameter of eighty thousand miles , Speeding with tail ' d meteors , throwing fire - balls like the rest , Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly , Storming , enjoying , planning , loving , cautioning , Backing and filling , appearing and disappearing , I tread day and night such roads .
Behold this swarthy face , these gray eyes , This beard , the white wool unclipt upon my neck , My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm ; Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly on the lips with robust love , And I on the crossing of the street or on the ship ' s deck give a kiss in return , We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea , We are those two natural and nonchalant persons .
You gray stones of interminable pavements !
I too many and many a time cross ' d the river of old , Watched the Twelfth - month sea - gulls , saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings , oscillating their bodies , Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow , Saw the slow - wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south , Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water , Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams , Look ' d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water , Look ' d on the haze on the hills southward and south - westward , Look ' d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet , Look ' d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving , Saw their approach , saw aboard those that were near me , Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops , saw the ships at anchor , The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars , The round masts , the swinging motion of the hulls , the slender serpentine pennants , The large and small steamers in motion , the pilots in their pilothouses , The white wake left by the passage , the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels , The flags of all nations , the falling of them at sunset , The scallop - edged waves in the twilight , the ladled cups , the frolic - some crests and glistening , The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer , the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks , On the river the shadowy group , the big steam - tug closely flank ' d on each side by the barges , the hay - boat , the belated lighter , On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night , Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses , and down into the clefts of streets .
1 Weapon shapely , naked , wan , Head from the mother ' s bowels drawn , Wooded flesh and metal bone , limb only one and lip only one , Gray - blue leaf by red - heat grown , helve produced from a little seed sown , Resting the grass amid and upon , To be lean ' d and to lean on .
All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it , ( Did you think it was in the white or gray stone ?
The aria sinking , All else continuing , the stars shining , The winds blowing , the notes of the bird continuous echoing , With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning , On the sands of Paumanok ' s shore gray and rustling , The yellow half - moon enlarged , sagging down , drooping , the face of the sea almost touching , The boy ecstatic , with his bare feet the waves , with his hair the atmosphere dallying , The love in the heart long pent , now loose , now at last tumultuously bursting , The aria ' s meaning , the ears , the soul , swiftly depositing , The strange tears down the cheeks coursing , The colloquy there , the trio , each uttering , The undertone , the savage old mother incessantly crying , To the boy ' s soul ' s questions sullenly timing , some drown ' d secret hissing , To the outsetting bard .
But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother , That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok ' s gray beach , With the thousand responsive songs at random , My own songs awaked from that hour , And with them the key , the word up from the waves , The word of the sweetest song and all songs , That strong and delicious word which , creeping to my feet , ( Or like some old crone rocking the cradle , swathed in sweet garments , bending aside ,) The sea whisper ' d me .
For as on the alert O steersman , you mind the loud admonition , The bows turn , the freighted ship tacking speeds away under her gray sails , The beautiful and noble ship with all her precious wealth speeds away gayly and safe .
The world below the brine , Forests at the bottom of the sea , the branches and leaves , Sea - lettuce , vast lichens , strange flowers and seeds , the thick tangle openings , and pink turf , Different colors , pale gray and green , purple , white , and gold , the play of light through the water , Dumb swimmers there among the rocks , coral , gluten , grass , rushes , and the aliment of the swimmers , Sluggish existences grazing there suspended , or slowly crawling close to the bottom , The sperm - whale at the surface blowing air and spray , or disporting with his flukes , The leaden - eyed shark , the walrus , the turtle , the hairy sea - leopard , and the sting - ray , Passions there , wars , pursuits , tribes , sight in those ocean - depths , breathing that thick - breathing air , as so many do , The change thence to the sight here , and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere , The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres .
After the sea - ship , after the whistling winds , After the white - gray sails taut to their spars and ropes , Below , a myriad myriad waves hastening , lifting up their necks , Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship , Waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling , blithely prying , Waves , undulating waves , liquid , uneven , emulous waves , Toward that whirling current , laughing and buoyant , with curves , Where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface , Larger and smaller waves in the spread of the ocean yearnfully flowing , The wake of the sea - ship after she passes , flashing and frolicsome under the sun , A motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments , Following the stately and rapid ship , in the wake following .
Those corpses of young men , Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets , those hearts pierc ' d by the gray lead , Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter ' d vitality .
} A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim
A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim , As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless , As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent , Three forms I see on stretchers lying , brought out there untended lying , Over each the blanket spread , ample brownish woolen blanket , Gray and heavy blanket , folding , covering all .
Curious I halt and silent stand , Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first just lift the blanket ; Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim , with well - gray ' d hair , and flesh all sunken about the eyes ?
I saw old General at bay , ( Old as he was , his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars ,) His small force was now completely hemm ' d in , in his works , He call ' d for volunteers to run the enemy ' s lines , a desperate emergency , I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks , but two or three were selected , I saw them receive their orders aside , they listen ' d with care , the adjutant was very grave , I saw them depart with cheerfulness , freely risking their lives .
5 Over the breast of the spring , the land , amid cities , Amid lanes and through old woods , where lately the violets peep ' d from the ground , spotting the gray debris , Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes , passing the endless grass , Passing the yellow - spear ' d wheat , every grain from its shroud in the dark - brown fields uprisen , Passing the apple - tree blows of white and pink in the orchards , Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave , Night and day journeys a coffin .
Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes , With the Fourth - month eve at sundown , and the gray smoke lucid and bright , With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous , indolent , sinking sun , burning , expanding the air , With the fresh sweet herbage under foot , and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific , In the distance the flowing glaze , the breast of the river , with a wind - dapple here and there , With ranging hills on the banks , with many a line against the sky , and shadows , And the city at hand with dwellings so dense , and stacks of chimneys , And all the scenes of life and the workshops , and the workmen homeward returning .
13 Sing on , sing on you gray - brown bird , Sing from the swamps , the recesses , pour your chant from the bushes , Limitless out of the dusk , out of the cedars and pines .
And the singer so shy to the rest receiv ' d me , The gray - brown bird I know receiv ' d us comrades three , And he sang the carol of death , and a verse for him I love .
15 To the tally of my soul , Loud and strong kept up the gray - brown bird , With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night .
Yet each to keep and all , retrievements out of the night , The song , the wondrous chant of the gray - brown bird , And the tallying chant , the echo arous ' d in my soul , With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe , With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird , Comrades mine and I in the midst , and their memory ever to keep , for the dead I loved so well , For the sweetest , wisest soul of all my days and lands -- and this for his dear sake , Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul , There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim .
To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven , The clear electric base and baritone of the world , The trombone duo , Libertad forever !
of you gray rocks !
The wretched features of ennuyes , the white features of corpses , the livid faces of drunkards , the sick - gray faces of onanists , The gash ' d bodies on battle - fields , the insane in their strong - door ' d rooms , the sacred idiots , the new - born emerging from gates , and the dying emerging from gates , The night pervades them and infolds them .
Cold dash of waves at the ferry - wharf , posh and ice in the river , half - frozen mud in the streets , A gray discouraged sky overhead , the short last daylight of December , A hearse and stages , the funeral of an old Broadway stage - driver , the cortege mostly drivers .
Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand , The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam , And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue ; O sun of noon refulgent !
In some unused lagoon , some nameless bay , On sluggish , lonesome waters , anchor ' d near the shore , An old , dismasted , gray and batter ' d ship , disabled , done , After free voyages to all the seas of earth , haul ' d up at last and hawser ' d tight , Lies rusting , mouldering .
Somehow I cannot let it go yet , funeral though it is , Let it remain back there on its nail suspended , With pink , blue , yellow , all blanch ' d , and the white now gray and ashy , One wither ' d rose put years ago for thee , dear friend ; But I do not forget thee .
