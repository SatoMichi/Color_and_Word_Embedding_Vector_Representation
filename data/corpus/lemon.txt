He was out in the garden on one such luminous and ghostly night , when the steady moonshine toned down all the colours of the garden until almost the strongest tints to be seen were the strong soft blue of the sky and the large lemon moon .
Across the clear space of cold silver and a pale lemon sky which was left by the gap in the ilex - trees there passed a slim , dark figure , a profile and the poise of a dark head like a bird ' s , which really pinned him to his seat with the point of coincidence .
The pure lemon of the sky faded into purer white as the great sunset silently collapsed .
THE great Muscari , most original of the young Tuscan poets , walked swiftly into his favourite restaurant , which overlooked the Mediterranean , was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon and orange trees .
" What a lovely colour a lemon is !"
The figure was much longer , leaner , and more athletic ; the pyjamas , though equally tropical , were comparatively tasteful , being of white with a light lemon - yellow stripe .
He handed lemonade about in a part of Naples where he was not known , but he lost his customers by putting too much water and too little lemon into this beverage .
2 Welcome are all earth ' s lands , each for its kind , Welcome are lands of pine and oak , Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig , Welcome are lands of gold , Welcome are lands of wheat and maize , welcome those of the grape , Welcome are lands of sugar and rice , Welcome the cotton - lands , welcome those of the white potato and sweet potato , Welcome are mountains , flats , sands , forests , prairies , Welcome the rich borders of rivers , table - lands , openings , Welcome the measureless grazing - lands , welcome the teeming soil of orchards , flax , honey , hemp ; Welcome just as much the other more hard - faced lands , Lands rich as lands of gold or wheat and fruit lands , Lands of mines , lands of the manly and rugged ores , Lands of coal , copper , lead , tin , zinc , Lands of iron -- lands of the make of the axe .
O dear to me my birth - things -- all moving things and the trees where I was born -- the grains , plants , rivers , Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow , distant , over flats of slivery sands or through swamps , Dear to me the Roanoke , the Savannah , the Altamahaw , the Pedee , the Tombigbee , the Santee , the Coosa and the Sabine , O pensive , far away wandering , I return with my soul to haunt their banks again , Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes , I float on the Okeechobee , I cross the hummock - land or through pleasant openings or dense forests , I see the parrots in the woods , I see the papaw - tree and the blossoming titi ; Again , sailing in my coaster on deck , I coast off Georgia , I coast up the Carolinas , I see where the live - oak is growing , I see where the yellow - pine , the scented bay - tree , the lemon and orange , the cypress , the graceful palmetto , I pass rude sea - headlands and enter Pamlico sound through an inlet , and dart my vision inland ; O the cotton plant !
