All the time there was a smell of lilac all round him .
There he saw the sister of Gregory , the girl with the gold - red hair , cutting lilac before breakfast , with the great unconscious gravity of a girl .
" Mr . Thackery , lilac and silver ; Roman Cap .
And , to be sure , nothing could be better imagined than Mr . Marlborough ' s lilac and silver , with a Roman cap .
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac , This is the lexicographer , this the chemist , this made a grammar of the old cartouches , These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas .
Collecting I traverse the garden the world , but soon I pass the gates , Now along the pond - side , now wading in a little , fearing not the wet , Now by the post - and - rail fences where the old stones thrown there , pick ' d from the fields , have accumulated , ( Wild - flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and partly cover them , beyond these I pass ,) Far , far in the forest , or sauntering later in summer , before I think where I go , Solitary , smelling the earthy smell , stopping now and then in the silence , Alone I had thought , yet soon a troop gathers around me , Some walk by my side and some behind , and some embrace my arms or neck , They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive , thicker they come , a great crowd , and I in the middle , Collecting , dispensing , singing , there I wander with them , Plucking something for tokens , tossing toward whoever is near me , Here , lilac , with a branch of pine , Here , out of my pocket , some moss which I pull ' d off a live - oak in Florida as it hung trailing down , Here , some pinks and laurel leaves , and a handful of sage , And here what I now draw from the water , wading in the pondside , ( O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me , and returns again never to separate from me , And this , O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades , this calamus - root shall , Interchange it youths with each other !
Around a palace , loftier , fairer , ampler than any yet , Earth ' s modern wonder , history ' s seven outstripping , High rising tier on tier with glass and iron facades , Gladdening the sun and sky , enhued in cheerfulest hues , Bronze , lilac , robin ' s - egg , marine and crimson , Over whose golden roof shall flaunt , beneath thy banner Freedom , The banners of the States and flags of every land , A brood of lofty , fair , but lesser palaces shall cluster .
Once Paumanok , When the lilac - scent was in the air and Fifth - month grass was growing , Up this seashore in some briers , Two feather ' d guests from Alabama , two together , And their nest , and four light - green eggs spotted with brown , And every day the he - bird to and fro near at hand , And every day the she - bird crouch ' d on her nest , silent , with bright eyes , And every day I , a curious boy , never too close , never disturbing them , Cautiously peering , absorbing , translating .
Ever - returning spring , trinity sure to me you bring , Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west , And thought of him I love .
3 In the dooryard fronting an old farm - house near the white - wash ' d palings , Stands the lilac - bush tall - growing with heart - shaped leaves of rich green , With many a pointed blossom rising delicate , with the perfume strong I love , With every leaf a miracle -- and from this bush in the dooryard , With delicate - color ' d blossoms and heart - shaped leaves of rich green , A sprig with its flower I break .
6 Coffin that passes through lanes and streets , Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land , With the pomp of the inloop ' d flags with the cities draped in black , With the show of the States themselves as of crape - veil ' d women standing , With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night , With the countless torches lit , with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads , With the waiting depot , the arriving coffin , and the sombre faces , With dirges through the night , with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn , With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour ' d around the coffin , The dim - lit churches and the shuddering organs -- where amid these you journey , With the tolling tolling bells ' perpetual clang , Here , coffin that slowly passes , I give you my sprig of lilac .
All over bouquets of roses , O death , I cover you over with roses and early lilies , But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first , Copious I break , I break the sprigs from the bushes , With loaded arms I come , pouring for you , For you and the coffins all of you O death .)
You only I hear -- yet the star holds me , ( but will soon depart ,) Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me .
16 Passing the visions , passing the night , Passing , unloosing the hold of my comrades ' hands , Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul , Victorious song , death ' s outlet song , yet varying ever - altering song , As low and wailing , yet clear the notes , rising and falling , flooding the night , Sadly sinking and fainting , as warning and warning , and yet again bursting with joy , Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven , As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses , Passing , I leave thee lilac with heart - shaped leaves , I leave thee there in the door - yard , blooming , returning with spring .
Yet each to keep and all , retrievements out of the night , The song , the wondrous chant of the gray - brown bird , And the tallying chant , the echo arous ' d in my soul , With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe , With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird , Comrades mine and I in the midst , and their memory ever to keep , for the dead I loved so well , For the sweetest , wisest soul of all my days and lands -- and this for his dear sake , Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul , There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim .
} Warble for Lilac - Time
Warble me now for joy of lilac - time , ( returning in reminiscence ,) Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature ' s sake , souvenirs of earliest summer , Gather the welcome signs , ( as children with pebbles or stringing shells ,) Put in April and May , the hylas croaking in the ponds , the elastic air , Bees , butterflies , the sparrow with its simple notes , Blue - bird and darting swallow , nor forget the high - hole flashing his golden wings , The tranquil sunny haze , the clinging smoke , the vapor , Shimmer of waters with fish in them , the cerulean above , All that is jocund and sparkling , the brooks running , The maple woods , the crisp February days and the sugar - making , The robin where he hops , bright - eyed , brown - breasted , With musical clear call at sunrise , and again at sunset , Or flitting among the trees of the apple - orchard , building the nest of his mate , The melted snow of March , the willow sending forth its yellow - green sprouts , For spring - time is here !
To glide with thee O soul , o ' er all , in all , as a ship o ' er the waters ; Gathering these hints , the preludes , the blue sky , the grass , the morning drops of dew , The lilac - scent , the bushes with dark green heart - shaped leaves , Wood - violets , the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence , Samples and sorts not for themselves alone , but for their atmosphere , To grace the bush I love -- to sing with the birds , A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence .
Apple orchards , the trees all cover ' d with blossoms ; Wheat fields carpeted far and near in vital emerald green ; The eternal , exhaustless freshness of each early morning ; The yellow , golden , transparent haze of the warm afternoon sun ; The aspiring lilac bushes with profuse purple or white flowers .
