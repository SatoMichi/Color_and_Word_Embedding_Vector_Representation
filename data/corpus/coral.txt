27 : 16 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making : they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds , purple , and broidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and agate .
" Put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyone will think it ' s a specimen .
There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes , belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf .
On one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water .
Over his ivory - inlaid table , Ahab presided like a mute , maned sea - lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs .
There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean .
" No use goin ' on ; de dam willains will keep a scougin ' and slappin ' each oder , Massa Stubb ; dey don ' t hear one word ; no use a - preaching to such dam g ' uttons as you call ' em , till dare bellies is full , and dare bellies is bottomless ; and when dey do get ' em full , dey wont hear you den ; for den dey sink in the sea , go fast to sleep on de coral , and can ' t hear noting at all , no more , for eber and eber ."
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes ; and the miser - merman , Wisdom , revealed his hoarded heaps ; and among the joyous , heartless , ever - juvenile eternities , Pip saw the multitudinous , God - omnipresent , coral insects , that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs .
The same waves wash the moles of the new - built Californian towns , but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men , and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands , older than Abraham ; while all between float milky - ways of coral isles , and low - lying , endless , unknown Archipelagoes , and impenetrable Japans .
Forthwith the sounds and seas , each creek and bay , With fry innumerable swarm , and shoals Of fish that with their fins , and shining scales , Glide under the green wave , in sculls that oft Bank the mid sea : part single , or with mate , Graze the sea - weed their pasture , and through groves Of coral stray ; or , sporting with quick glance , Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold ; Or , in their pearly shells at ease , attend Moist nutriment ; or under rocks their food In jointed armour watch : on smooth the seal And bended dolphins play : part huge of bulk Wallowing unwieldy , enormous in their gait , Tempest the ocean : there leviathan , Hugest of living creatures , on the deep Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims , And seems a moving land ; and at his gills Draws in , and at his trunk spouts out , a sea .
The world below the brine , Forests at the bottom of the sea , the branches and leaves , Sea - lettuce , vast lichens , strange flowers and seeds , the thick tangle openings , and pink turf , Different colors , pale gray and green , purple , white , and gold , the play of light through the water , Dumb swimmers there among the rocks , coral , gluten , grass , rushes , and the aliment of the swimmers , Sluggish existences grazing there suspended , or slowly crawling close to the bottom , The sperm - whale at the surface blowing air and spray , or disporting with his flukes , The leaden - eyed shark , the walrus , the turtle , the hairy sea - leopard , and the sting - ray , Passions there , wars , pursuits , tribes , sight in those ocean - depths , breathing that thick - breathing air , as so many do , The change thence to the sight here , and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere , The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres .
